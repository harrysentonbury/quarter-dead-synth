# quarter-dead-synth

### A bit of synth you can play on your computer keyboard.

I called it quarter dead because that was the first tune that popped out
of my fingers after I tapped a key and heard the first note. I am pretty
sure you need at least python 3.7 to run it.

## python3.7

### Prerequisites

```
sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools
```
```
sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev libasound2-dev
```

### dependences

```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install scipy
pip3 install simpleaudio
```
Also tkinter.

```
sudo apt-get install python-tk
```
